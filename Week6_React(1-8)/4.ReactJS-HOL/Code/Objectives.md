1. Explain the Need and Benefits of Component Lifecycle
In React, a component undergoes a lifecycle from its creation to its removal from the DOM. Understanding the component lifecycle is essential for managing side effects, optimizing performance, and maintaining application stability.

Need for Component Lifecycle:

-It provides control over different phases of a component’s existence: mounting, updating, and unmounting.

-It enables the execution of code at specific stages, such as fetching data, adding event listeners, or cleaning up resources.

Benefits:

-Efficient data fetching and synchronization with external systems.

-Performance optimization by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

-Proper cleanup of resources (e.g., timers, subscriptions) to prevent memory leaks.

-Enhanced debugging by understanding the sequence of component behavior.

2. Identify Various Lifecycle Hook Methods
React provides specific methods that are triggered at different phases of a class component’s lifecycle. These methods allow developers to run custom logic during component rendering and updates.

-Mounting Phase:

constructor() – Initializes the component’s state and binds methods.

componentDidMount() – Invoked once the component is inserted into the DOM. Ideal for AJAX calls or DOM interactions.

-Updating Phase:

shouldComponentUpdate() – Determines whether the component should re-render. Useful for performance optimization.

componentDidUpdate() – Called after the component updates. Used for reacting to changes in props or state.

-Unmounting Phase:

componentWillUnmount() – Invoked before the component is removed. Useful for cleanup tasks like removing event listeners or canceling network requests.

For functional components, the useEffect() Hook is used to handle side effects and can replicate the behavior of the above lifecycle methods depending on how it is configured.

3. List the Sequence of Steps in Rendering a Component
The typical sequence of steps involved in rendering a class-based React component is as follows:

-Mounting Phase:

constructor() is called to initialize the component.

render() is invoked to generate the virtual DOM.

The component is mounted to the actual DOM.

componentDidMount() is executed after the component is rendered.

-Updating Phase (when props or state changes):

shouldComponentUpdate() decides whether the component should re-render.

If true, render() is called again.

The updated virtual DOM is compared to the previous one (diffing).

componentDidUpdate() is called after the changes are committed.

-Unmounting Phase:

componentWillUnmount() is called before the component is destroyed and removed from the DOM.

Understanding this sequence helps developers manage component behavior effectively and ensures better application design and maintenance.
