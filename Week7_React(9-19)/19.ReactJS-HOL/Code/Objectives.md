## Understanding Need for Isolation in Testing

Isolation in testing ensures that each unit or component of an application is tested independently without relying on the behavior of external systems or other units. This approach:
- Increases the reliability of tests by reducing side effects and dependencies.
- Makes it easier to identify the root cause of issues, as failures will be linked to the specific unit under test.
- Enables parallel development because units with isolated tests can be validated even if other parts of the system are incomplete or under development.

## Understanding the Concept of Mocking

Mocking is a technique used in testing to replace real objects, modules, or functions with simulated versions that mimic their behavior. Mocks:
- Allow tests to run quickly by simulating responses from external services or APIs.
- Help achieve isolation by ensuring that the unit under test interacts only with the controlled behavior of mocks, not real implementations.
- Enable developers to easily simulate edge cases, failures, or specific scenarios that may be difficult to reproduce with real objects.

## Using Jest for Unit Testing and Mocking

Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript and React applications that provides built-in capabilities for both unit testing and mocking:
- **Unit Testing:** Jest allows developers to write and execute tests that validate the behavior of individual units or components.
- **Mocking:** Jest can automatically mock modules (such as HTTP requests or database calls) and also provides utilities like `jest.fn()` and `jest.mock()` for manual mocks.
- **Benefits:** Using Jest for testing and mocking leads to more reliable code, faster feedback during development, and easier maintenance as applications grow.
